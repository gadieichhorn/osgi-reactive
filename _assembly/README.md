Assembly Module
===============

This module assembles application definitions from bndrun files into standalone executable JAR files.

Each bndrun file should reference the index XML file generated by the [index module](../_index/README.md) as follows:

    -standalone: ../_index/target/index.xml

A separate application JAR is produced for each bndrun file listed in the `<bndruns>` section of the configuration for the `bnd-export-maven-plugin` (see `pom.xml`). These JAR files can be run from the command line as follows:

    java -jar application.jar

Prior to assembly the bndrun file can be launched directly from the command line with bnd:

    bnd run application.bndrun

... or launched from an IDE that supports launching such files, e.g. Bndtools 3.3+, IntelliJ Ultimate 2017.1.3+.
